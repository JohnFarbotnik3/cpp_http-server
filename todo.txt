> HTTP handlers
- create a "src/http/handlers" folder for storing various <request> processing functions.
	these functions should generate a <response> which can then be sent in main http request function.
- first create a simple static file-server, and experiment with cache behaviour.
- then try to create a simple request proxying server to replace current NodeJS proxy implementation.
- then start working on ML projects and interfacing them with the browser.
