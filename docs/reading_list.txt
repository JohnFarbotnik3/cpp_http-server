> note about responding to request methods:
"""
The set of methods allowed by a target resource can be listed in an
   Allow header field (Section 7.4.1).  However, the set of allowed
   methods can change dynamically.  When a request method is received
   that is unrecognized or not implemented by an origin server, the
   origin server SHOULD respond with the 501 (Not Implemented) status
   code.  When a request method is received that is known by an origin
   server but not allowed for the target resource, the origin server
   SHOULD respond with the 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code.
