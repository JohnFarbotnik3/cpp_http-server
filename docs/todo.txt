> config
- some handlers should have a config struct, containing info loaded from config files.


> logging
- start logging stuff to file (in format: "[debug-level] TEXT ABC 123")


> HTTP handlers
* first create a simple static file-server, and experiment with cache behaviour.
* then try to create a simple request proxying server to replace current NodeJS proxy implementation.
	- will require writing an HTTPClient, so that the server can also act as a client.
	- try to mirror the state of the connections between client-side and server-side.
* also try creating an SQLite server with database behaviour.
* then start working on ML projects and interfacing them with the browser.


> create combined server for ff-extensions
- will require multiple features/handlers under the same umbrella:
	- sqlite DB (ex: for storing maps of form: Map<db_name, Map<post_id, post_json>>)
	- file get/put (ex: for thumbnails)
	- ML service (ex: for processing thumbnail + post_json)
		^ map from {thumbnail, one-hot-tags-encoding} to {estimated_post_score}
- sqlite DB and file get/put can likely be done under the base HTTP-server project in "handlers" folder.
